# Dyck Paths

Dyck paths are a type of lattice path in combinatorics that are used to model various phenomena in mathematics and computer science. They are named after the mathematician Walther von Dyck.

## Definition

A Dyck path is a lattice path consisting of steps in the positive x and y directions, starting at the origin (0,0) and ending at a point with equal x and y coordinates, with each step either going up (↑) or going right (→). Additionally, a Dyck path never goes below the diagonal line y = x.

## Properties

- The number of Dyck paths of length 2n is given by the nth Catalan number.
- Dyck paths are closely related to balanced parentheses expressions and are used in various applications such as in parsing algorithms and lattice models in statistical mechanics.
